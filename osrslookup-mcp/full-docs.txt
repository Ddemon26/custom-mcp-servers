Grand Exchange Database API
The Grand Exchange Database, like the Bestiary API, is vast. It encompasses the Item Database which shows images of items not purchasable on the Grand Exchange itself and the catalogue information on tradeable items within the Grand Exchange. Queries in the API return JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).


A note for OSRS - if you wish to access Old School Runescape's Grand Exchange, change "m=itemdb_rs" to "m=itemdb_oldschool" in the URL. Along with this, there is only 1 category. A proper call to get page 1 of all items that start with the letter 'c' for the OSRS API would look like: https://secure.runescape.com/m=itemdb_oldschool/api/catalogue/items.json?category=1&alpha=c&page=1. Alpha is explained later in the wiki but it is the first letter of the item.
Configuration
info returns the runedate of when the Grand Exchange Database was last updated. The URL for the info query is https://secure.runescape.com/m=itemdb_rs/api/info.json.

Catalogue
category
category returns the number of items determined by the first letter. The URL for category queries is https://services.runescape.com/m=itemdb_rs/api/catalogue/category.json?category=X where X is the category identification number as listed below for all possible types. For example, if we want to find all tradeable summoning familiars, we'd go to https://services.runescape.com/m=itemdb_rs/api/catalogue/category.json?category=9, which would result in

{"types":[],"alpha":[{"letter":"#","items":0},{"letter":"a","items":6},{"letter":"b","items":8},{"letter":"c","items":1},{"letter":"d","items":3},{"letter":"e","items":2},{"letter":"f","items":3},{"letter":"g","items":5},{"letter":"h","items":2},{"letter":"i","items":5},{"letter":"j","items":0},{"letter":"k","items":1},{"letter":"l","items":2},{"letter":"m","items":5},{"letter":"n","items":1},{"letter":"o","items":1},{"letter":"p","items":4},{"letter":"q","items":0},{"letter":"r","items":3},{"letter":"s","items":27},{"letter":"t","items":2},{"letter":"u","items":1},{"letter":"v","items":5},{"letter":"w","items":2},{"letter":"x","items":0},{"letter":"y","items":0},{"letter":"z","items":0}]}
Variable	Description	Data type
letter	The first letter of an item	string
items	The number of items	int
items
items returns the first 12 items in the category given as shown below determined by the first letter. The URL for items queries are https://services.runescape.com/m=itemdb_rs/api/catalogue/items.json?category=X&alpha=Y&page=Z where X is the category identification number, Y is the starting letter (lower case) for the items and Z is the page number beginning at 1. Note that any items that start with a number must instead use %23 instead of #.

For example, if we want to find all tradeable summoning familiars that begin with "c", we'd go to https://services.runescape.com/m=itemdb_rs/api/catalogue/items.json?category=9&alpha=c&page=1, which would result in

detail
detail returns current price and price trends information on tradeable items in the Grand Exchange, the category, item image and examine for the given item. The URL for detail queries is https://services.runescape.com/m=itemdb_rs/api/catalogue/detail.json?item=X where X is the ItemID.

For example, if we want the information on steadfast boots, we'd go to https://services.runescape.com/m=itemdb_rs/api/catalogue/detail.json?item=21787, which would result in

{"item":{"icon":"https://services.runescape.com/m=itemdb_rs/4856_obj_sprite.gif?id=21787","icon_large":"https://services.runescape.com/m=itemdb_rs/4856_obj_big.gif?id=21787","id":21787,"type":"Miscellaneous","typeIcon":"https://www.runescape.com/img/categories/Miscellaneous","name":"Steadfast boots","description":"A pair of powerful-looking boots.","current":{"trend":"neutral","price":"17.0m"},"today":{"trend":"negative","price":"-897.2k"},"members":"true","day30":{"trend":"positive","change":"+27.0%"},"day90":{"trend":"positive","change":"+30.0%"},"day180":{"trend":"positive","change":"+8.0%"}}}

Images
The Grand Exchange Database can return item images with obj_big and obj_sprite. These images can sometimes be skewed since it includes items that might not necessarily be seen in game such as placeholder graphics for most cosmetic overrides from Solomon's General Store, use the mtx pet icon for various pets and the achievement banner in other cases. Many items from Treasure Hunter and Solomon's General Store can be seen before being released in-game by sometimes over a month ahead.

The URL for obj_big queries is https://services.runescape.com/m=itemdb_rs/obj_big.gif?id=X where X is the ItemID.
The URL for obj_sprite queries is https://services.runescape.com/m=itemdb_rs/obj_sprite.gif?id=X where X is the ItemID.
For example, if we want to see the image for Mod Daze's homework, we'd go to https://services.runescape.com/m=itemdb_rs/obj_big.gif?id=34775 for a detailed image or https://services.runescape.com/m=itemdb_rs/obj_sprite.gif?id=34775 for the inventory icon. Unlike the images as seen in the game, the Grand Exchange Database images have a completely solid line surrounding items, which is different from ingame since there are breaks in images for borders.

Note that item images retrieved outside of the above place the most recent runedate before obj_big and obj_sprite. When the next system update occurs and info.json is updated, the link no longer operates for those that had a runedate in the link.

Graph
Graph shows the prices each day of a given item for the previous 180 days. The timecode is the number of milliseconds that has passed since 1 January 1970 and the price is the market value of the item for the given day. When no price information is available, then a value of zero is returned.

The URL for a graph is https://services.runescape.com/m=itemdb_rs/api/graph/X.json where X is the ItemID. For example, if we want to know the last 180 days for steadfast boots, we'd go to https://services.runescape.com/m=itemdb_rs/api/graph/21787.json, where the previous three days, truncated for this article, would start out as

{"daily":{"1419897600000":15633853,"1419984000000":15475988,"1420070400000":15379017},"average":{"1419897600000":14708793,"1419984000000":14764787,"1420070400000":148288055}}
Variable	Description	Data type
daily	The item trade history over the past day (Grand Exchange value at the given timestamp)	[string...] (array of strings)
average	The item trade history for today (30 day moving average for the given timestamp)	[string...] (array of strings)
timecode	The first number showing the milliseconds since 1 January 1970	int
price	The second number showing the exact price and the average price	int
Bulk data
There's almost no scenario where you should be looping over every item if you need bulk GE data. If you need bulk GE data, see: RuneScape:Grand Exchange Market Watch/Usage and APIs#Bulk data API.
